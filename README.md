# Stablecoin Project

## 1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
   - **Chainlink Price Feed**
   - Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC 

## 2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
   - People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral (overcollateralized)

## 3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
   - **wETH**
   - **wBTC**

## 4. Fuzzing Test
   - **What are our invariants?**
